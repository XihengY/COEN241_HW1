First, git clone from GitHub;

Then, cd into the file;

Then, chmod +777 to give the permission to run_cpu1.sh, run_cpu2.sh, run_cpu3.sh, run_fileio1.sh, run_fileio2.sh, run_fileio3.sh;

Run run_cpu1.sh and run_fileio1.sh to conduct measurements in the first scenario.

Run run_cpu2.sh and run_fileio2.sh to conduct measurements in the second scenario;

Run run_cpu3.sh and run_fileio3.sh to conduct measurements in the third scenario.

And the sysbench printing results are saved into test_cpu1.txt, test_cpu2.txt, test_cpu3.txt, test_fileio1.txt, test_fileio2.txt, test_fileio3.txt;
